# Hi, I'm Theodor Crosswell

I'm a data enthusiast passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and building intelligent, data-driven applications. My expertise spans the entire data lifecycle, from creating robust data pipelines and performing in-depth analysis with SQL and Python to developing AI-powered search tools and crafting compelling visual stories with Power BI and Excel.

### 💡 About Me

I thrive on uncovering the narrative hidden within data and building innovative solutions to make information more accessible and actionable. My approach is rooted in a solid understanding of data modeling, advanced querying, and a keen eye for effective visualization and application design. I enjoy building robust, scalable systems that empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

*   **AI and Semantic Search:** Building applications with local Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide AI-powered answers and semantic search capabilities, making large volumes of text easily searchable.
*   **Cloud Deployment & Containerization:** Deploying scalable applications using Docker for containerization and Google Cloud Platform for cloud hosting and services.
*   **Frontend Development & Interactive Mapping:** Building responsive user interfaces with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and creating interactive data visualizations using libraries like Leaflet.js.
*   **Data Pipeline & Web Scraping:** Developing automated data pipelines to scrape, clean, and validate data using high-performance libraries like polars and patito for data model validation.
*   **Data Visualization & Dashboarding:** Crafting interactive and intuitive dashboards in Power BI and Excel that provide at-a-glance KPIs and deep-dive analytical capabilities.
*   **Advanced SQL:** Writing clean, efficient, and modular SQL using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Stored Procedures to perform complex analysis and build reliable data pipelines.
*   **Data Modeling & Warehousing:** Designing and implementing layered data architectures (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and star schemas to create a single source of truth for analytics.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Systematically investigating datasets to uncover patterns, validate assumptions, and answer critical business questions.

The map is served via a FastAPI backend and is explorable with a Leaflet.js frontend, allowing users to discover textual connections and patterns.
    > 
    > Demo site: [kjv-search-tools.online](http://kjv-search-tools.online)
    >
    > *`Skills: FastAPI, Leaflet.js, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, Polars, NumPy, Pillow`*

    > A powerful tool for performing semantic search and receiving AI-powered answers from the "All The Preaching" transcripts. This project utilizes a locally-run Large Language Model (LLM) and a user-friendly Streamlit interface to make a vast library of sermons easily searchable.
    >
    > *`Skills: Semantic Search, AI Q&A, Local LLM, Streamlit, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers`*

*   **[All The Preaching - Web Scraping Pipeline](https://github.com/TheodorCrosswell/All_The_Preaching_Web_Scraping_Pipeline)**
    > A robust data pipeline that automatically scrapes, cleans, and validates sermon transcripts. This project uses `polars` for high-performance data manipulation and `patito` for data model validation, preparing the text for embedding into a vector database for AI applications.
    >
    > *`Skills: Data Pipeline, Web Scraping, Data Validation, polars, patito`*

### 🗄️ MS SQL Server

*   **[MSSQL Data Warehouse Implementation](https://github.com/TheodorCrosswell/DataWarehouseProject)**
    > An end-to-end implementation of a layered data warehouse (Bronze, Silver, Gold) in MS SQL Server. Uses stored procedures to automate ETL processes and creates a structured, analytics-ready data model with fact and dimension tables.
    >
    > *`Skills: Data Warehousing, ETL/ELT, Stored Procedures, Data Modeling, Schema Design`*

*   **[SQL Advanced Data Analysis](https://github.com/TheodorCrosswell/AdvancedDataAnalysisProject)**
    > A project focused on deriving business insights using advanced SQL. Features complex queries with CTEs and Window Functions to create production-ready reports and views for customer and product analysis, showcasing a refactoring process from inefficient queries to modular, optimized code.
    >
    > *`Skills: Advanced SQL, CTEs, Window Functions, Data Segmentation, KPI Calculation`*

*   **[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL](https://github.com/TheodorCrosswell/ExploratoryDataAnalysisProject)**
    > A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed entirely in SQL. This project showcases a systematic approach to investigating a database, from schema discovery to answering key business questions about customers, products, and sales trends.
    >
    > *`Skills: Exploratory Data Analysis, SQL Querying, Business Acumen, Ranking Functions`*

### 📊 Power BI

*   **[Data Jobs Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/TheodorCrosswell/DataJobsDashboard_PowerBI)**
    > An interactive dashboard analyzing over 400,000 data job postings to explore trends in salaries, benefits, and global distribution. Features dynamic filtering and drill-through capabilities for deep-dive analysis into specific job roles.
    >
    > *`Skills: Data Visualization, Data Modeling, UI/UX Design, Drill-Through`*

---

### 📈 Excel

*   **[Coffee Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/TheodorCrosswell/ExcelDashboardProject)**
    > A fully interactive sales dashboard built entirely in Excel. Demonstrates advanced data modeling and visualization using PivotTables, Slicers, and Timelines to analyze sales performance across different countries, products, and customer segments.
    >
    > *`Skills: Advanced Excel, PivotTables & Charts, Slicers, Dashboard Design`*
