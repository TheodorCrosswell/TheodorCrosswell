# Hi, I'm Theodor Crosswell 👋

I'm a data professional passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling visual stories. My expertise lies in the end-to-end business intelligence workflow, from data extraction and transformation using SQL to building interactive, user-friendly dashboards in Power BI and Excel.

### 💡 About Me

I thrive on uncovering the narrative hidden within data. My approach is rooted in a solid understanding of data modeling, advanced querying, and a keen eye for effective visualization. I enjoy building robust, scalable solutions that empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

-   **Data Visualization & Dashboarding:** Crafting interactive and intuitive dashboards in Power BI and Excel that provide at-a-glance KPIs and deep-dive analytical capabilities.
-   **Advanced SQL:** Writing clean, efficient, and modular SQL using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and Stored Procedures to perform complex analysis and build reliable data pipelines.
-   **Data Modeling & Warehousing:** Designing and implementing layered data architectures (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and star schemas to create a single source of truth for analytics.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Systematically investigating datasets to uncover patterns, validate assumptions, and answer critical business questions.
